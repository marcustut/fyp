This research is a study on the young generation views and acceptance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) art based on the painting and literature created by the latest AI technologies to understand AI advancement and capabilities in the domain of art. An online questionnaire is sent to a university’s undergraduates in a local university with 202 responds. Data is analyzed by PSPP utilizing Cronbach’s Alpha to test the reliability of the questionnaire items.'"
