# summary_text

-  The Rococo style began in France in the 1730s as a reaction against the more formal and geometric Style Louis XIV . It soon spread to other parts of Europe, particularly northern Italy, Austria, southern Germany, Central Europe and Russia . The term rococo was first used in print in 1825 to describe decoration which was "out of style and old-fashioned"
- Rocaille style, or French Rococo, appeared in Paris during the reign of Louis XV, and flourished between about 1723 and 1759 . Main ornaments of Rococo are: asymmetrical shells, acanthus and other leaves, birds, bouquets of flowers, fruits, musical instruments, angels and Chinoiserie (pagodas, dragons, monkeys, bizarre flowers and Chinese people) The style integrated painting, molded stucco, and wood carving, and quadratura, or illusionist ceiling paintings .
- Rococo decorative style reached its summit in southern Germany and Austria from the 1730s until the 1770s . Notable decorative painters included Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, who painted ceilings and murals of both churches and palazzos . The Venetian Rococo also featured exceptional glassware, particularly Murano glass, often engraved and coloured, which was exported across Europe .

# summary_text

-  In Great Britain, rococo was called the "French taste" and had less influence on design and the decorative arts than in continental Europe . William Hogarth helped develop a theoretical foundation for Rococo beauty . Mahogany made its appearance in England in about 1720, and became popular for furniture, along with walnut wood .
- The ornamental style called rocaille emerged in France between 1710 and 1750, mostly during the regency and reign of Louis XV . Its principal characteristics were picturesque detail, curves and counter-curves, asymmetry, and a theatrical exuberance . By 1785, Rococo had passed out of fashion in France, replaced by the order and seriousness of Neoclassical artists like Jacques-Louis David .
- Craftsmen in Rome, Milan and Venice all produced lavishly decorated furniture and decorative items . The most extravagant rocaille forms were found in the consoles, tables designed to stand against walls . The period also saw the arrival of Chinoiserie, often in the form of lacquered and gilded commodes .

# summary_text

-  The most elaborate examples of rococo sculpture were found in Spain, Austria and southern Germany, in the decoration of palaces and churches . A new form of small-scale sculpture appeared, the porcelain figure, or small group of figures, initially replacing sugar sculptures on grand dining room tables, but soon popular for mantelpieces and furniture .
- Rococo period existed in music history, although it is not as well known as the earlier Baroque and later Classical forms . Rococo fashion was based on extravagance, elegance, refinement and decoration . In the second half of the 18th century, a reaction against the Rococo style occurred . Led by Christoph Willibald Gluck, this reaction ushered in the Classical era .
- After the death of Louis XIV the clothing styles began to change . The fashion took a turn to a lighter, more frivolous style, transitioning from the baroque period to the well-known style of Rococo . The later period was known for their pastel colours, more revealing frocks and the plethora of frills, ruffles, bows, and lace as trims .
