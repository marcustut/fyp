# summary_text

- A 1960s ode to Black bodies is reborn as a riveting modern opera . The Harlem-centred Black Arts Movement of the 1960s and '70s sought to establish and celebrate Black identity in the United States as distinct from the white dominant Western culture . Henry Dumas was killed by a New York City police officer in 1968, in what is believed to be a case of mistaken identity .
- LA Opera's immersive film, directed by Adam D’Arpino, stars Jérémy Adonis, Ayanna Witter-Johnson, Lateef Williams and a dancer . The project is a collaboration between LA Opera Photography and LA Opera Productions . Psyche is a digital magazine that illuminates the human condition through psychology, philosophy and the arts .
