# The Rococo style is one of the most

- Rococo is an exceptionally ornamental and theatrical style of architecture, art and decoration. The Rococo style began in France in the 1730s as a reaction against the more formal and geometric Louis XIV style. It soon spread to other parts of Europe, particularly northern Italy, Austria, southern Germany, Central Europe and Russia. The term rococo was first used in print in 1825 to describe decoration "out of style and old-fashioned"

# The history of the French Rococo has been

- Rocaille style, or French Rococo, appeared in Paris during the reign of Louis XV, and flourished between about 1723 and 1759. Main ornaments of Rococo are: asymmetrical shells, acanthus and other leaves, birds, bouquets of flowers, fruits, musical instruments, angels and Chinoiserie (pagodas, dragons, monkeys, bizarre flowers and Chinese people)

# The history of Rococo decorative style has been

- Rococo decorative style reached its summit in southern Germany and Austria from the 1730s until the 1770s. Venetian commodes imitated the curving lines and carved ornament of the French rocaille. Notable decorative painters included Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, who painted ceilings and murals of both churches and palazzos.

# One of Germany's most famous Rococo

- The Würzburg Residence (1737–1744) was built for the Prince-Bishop of Wurzburg by Balthasar Neumann. The Hall of Mirrors in the interior, by the painter and stucco sculptor Johann Baptist Zimmermann, was far more exuberant than any French Rococo. In Great Britain, rococo was called the "French taste" and had less influence on design and the decorative arts than in continental Europe.

# Mahogany is one of the most popular wood

- William Hogarth helped develop a theoretical foundation for Rococo beauty. The undulating lines and S-curves prominent in Rococo were the basis for grace and beauty in art or nature. Mahogany made its appearance in England in about 1720, and immediately became popular for furniture, along with walnut wood.

# One of France's most famous furniture

- The ornamental style called rocaille emerged in France between 1710 and 1750, mostly during the regency and reign of Louis XV. Its principal characteristics were picturesque detail, curves and counter-curves, asymmetry, and a theatrical exuberance. The best known furniture designer of the period was Juste-Aurèle Meissonnier (1695–1750)

# rocailles were one of the

- The most extravagant rocaille forms were found in the consoles, tables designed to stand against walls. The period also saw the arrival of Chinoiserie, often in the form of lacquered and gilded commodes, called falcon de Chine of Vernis Martin, after the ebenist who introduced the technique to France.

# Rococo painting was one of the most popular

- The style particularly influenced François Lemoyne, who painted the lavish decoration of the ceiling of the Salon of Hercules at the Palace of Versailles, completed in 1735. In Austria and Southern Germany, Italian painting had the largest effect on the Rococo style. The Venetian painter Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, assisted by his son, was invited to paint frescoes for the Würzburg Residence. The most prominent painter of Bavarian rococo churches was Johann Baptist Zimmermann.

# rococo sculpture was one of the most

- The most elaborate examples of rococo sculpture were found in Spain, Austria and southern Germany. The El Transparente altar, in the major chapel of Toledo Cathedral is a towering sculpture of polychrome marble and gilded stucco, combined with paintings, statues and symbols. A new form of small-scale sculpture appeared, the porcelain figure, or small group of figures.

# Tchaikovsky's The Variations on a Rococo

- The Rococo music style developed out of baroque music. It can be characterized as light, intimate music with extremely elaborate and refined forms of ornamentation. In the second half of the 18th century, a reaction against the Rococo style occurred. Led by Christoph Willibald Gluck, this reaction ushered in the Classical era. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky wrote The Variations on a Rococo Theme for cello and orchestra in 1877.

# The 'pannier' and 'man

- The 'pannier' and 'mantua' became fashionable around 1718, they were wide hoops under the dress to extend the hips out sideways. This gave the Rococo period the iconic dress of wide hips combined with the large amount of decoration on the garments. The Watteau pleats[45] also became more popular, named after the painter Jean-Antoine.
