# Software vs Other Types of Projects

- Project Management Concepts: Project Life Cycle, Project Appraisal and Evaluation. Software vs Other Types of Projects: Triple Constraints in Projects. Invisibility – with software, progress is not immediately visible compared to building a bridge. Complexity – per dollar, software products contain more complexity than other engineered artefacts.

# Project managers’ mantra: To develop the system on time, within budget and to the required quality

- Project managers need to face 3 major constraints (triple constraints):o Schedule (Time)o Budget (Cost)o Quality. Project managers’ mantra: To develop the system on time, within budget and to the required quality. The project life cycle typically consists of Develop Identify and Terminate proposed 4 stages: a Need the projectsolution Perform the project.

# A Project Charter is a Formal Project Authorization

- Project planning is iterative and must be continually reviewed. A kick-off meeting is held to establish the customer requirements, goals, needs, and expected benefits. A project charter is a formal project authorization which documents the shared understanding of a project’s scope, development and objectives.

# Request for Proposal (RFP): A Request for Proposal

- Request for Proposal (RFP) is a procurement document used to request proposals from prospective vendors of products or services. The Project Manager gathers the information needed, analyzes it and identifies deviations that are significant. This may include re-planning and establishing new agreements. If you were a customer, how would you evaluate the proposals received from software houses?

# A Comparative Assessment of Project Benefits and Costs

- A comparative assessment of all the benefits you anticipate from the project and all the costs required to introduce the project, perform it and support the changes resulting from it. Helps you too Decide whether to undertake a project or decide which of several projects to undertake. o Frame appropriate project objectives. o Develop appropriate before and after measures of project success.

# Simple and intuitive . Payback Period: Time taken to break even

- Year Project 1 Project 2 Project 3 Project 40 Project 40 -100,000 -1,000,000 Project 40. Advantages: Simple and intuitive. Disadvantages: Do not consider risk. Payback Period: Time taken to break even or pay back the initial investment.

---

# The Accounting Rate of Return

- Project 3 has the shortest payback period. However, Project 2 and Project 4 are more profitable than Project 3. The Accounting Rate of Return (ARR) provides a way of comparing the net profitability to the investment required. It is simple to calculate and not particularly sensitive to small forecasting errors.

# Project Appraisal and Evaluation: 1 Project 2 Project 3 Project 40 -100,000-1,000,000 . 30 Project 13 Project 13 10,000 200,000 30,000 Project 13 ROI = 50,000/5x100 = 10% ROI

# Present Present Value (NPV): A method used to determine the current value of all future cash flows

- Present present value (NPV) is method used to determine the current value of all future cash flows generated by a project, including the initial capital investment. Takes into account the profitability of a project and timing of the cash flows that are produced. View: Receiving RM100 today is better than having to wait until next year to receive it.

# Project Appraisal and Evaluation: Project 1 or Project 2 is better to pursue

- Using a 10% discount rate, calculate the NPV for Project 3. Applying the discount factors to project 36Net Present Value (NPV) 1. 3 Project Appraisal and Evaluation: Project 1 or Project 2 is more beneficial to pursue. Based on the NPVs, decide whether Project 1 is better to pursue Project 2 or Project 1.

# Plan scope management

- Plan scope management is a six-step process that documents how the project scope will be defined, validated, and controlled. Define and document the features and functions of the products to be produced during the project as well as the processes used for creating them. Create WBS5. Validate scope6 Control scope is one of six main processes.

# Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Subdivide the major project deliverables into smaller, more manageable components. Can be organized around project products, project phase, or using project management process groups. Guideline: breakdown the work until each task can be performed by one person within 8-80 hours.

---

# Planning, Development, Execution, and Control of Project Schedules

- Plan Schedule Management: Establish policies, procedures, and documentation for planning, developing, managing, executing, and controlling the project schedule. Define Activities: Identify specific activities (from the WBS) that the project team members and stakeholders must perform to product the project deliverables. Estimate Activity Resources: Estimate how much resources – people, equipment, and materials – a project team should use to perform activities.

# Project Time Management: 4 Knowledge & Attributes

- Project Time Management: 4 Knowledge & Attributes of a Project Manager. Estimate Activity Durations: Estimate durations needed to complete individual activities. Develop Schedule: Analyze activity sequences, activity resource estimates, and activity duration estimates to create the project schedule. Processes: Plan Cost Management, Estimate Cost, Determine Budget and Control Costs.

# Cost Estimation and Budgeting

- 4 Knowledge & Attributes of a Project Manager: 4. 4. Plan Cost Estimate Determine Control Management Cost Budget Costs. Estimate Cost: Develop an approximation or estimation of the costs of the resources (people, equipment, materials, hardware, software) needed to complete a project. Control Costs: Control Costs.

# Project Quality Management: Project Quality Management Plan, Quality Measurement, Quality Evaluation

- Project Quality Management: Main outputs: quality management plan, quality measurement, e. g. failure rates of metrics, quality checklists, process improvement products produced, availability of plan goods and services, customer satisfaction ratings. Project Quality: Periodically evaluate overall project performance to ensure that the project will satisfy the relevant quality standards.

# Project leaders have little power

- “Silos” create longer decisions cycles, ‘silos’ create longer decision cycles. Project leaders have little power. Project managers report to the CEO. ‘Project managers’ often report to both a functional manager and one or more project managers. E. g. IT personnel at many companies split their time between two or more projects.

# Resource Assignment, Resource Loading, Resource Leveling for Project Management

- Project managers have staff from various functional areas working on their projects. Project managers need to have a strong influencing & distribution of resource usage. negotiating skills are often. The tool and techniques: Resource assignment, Resource loading, Resource leveling.

# Procurement Management

- Includes the processes required to acquire goods and services for a project from outside the organization. Organizations can be either the buyer or seller of products or services under a contract. 4 main processes: 1. Plan Procurement Management, 1. Conduct procurement, 2. Control Procurements. Main outputs: change requests and updates to the risk register.

# Project Stakeholder Management

- Project Stakeholder Management includes the processes required to identify the people, groups, or organizations that could impact or be impacted by the project, to analyze stakeholder expectations and their impact on the project. Identify Stakeholders and analyze their interests, involvement, interdependencies, influence, and potential impact on project success. Develop appropriate management strategies to effectively engage stakeholders throughout the project life cycle.

---

# Management of Stakeholder Engagement

- Manage Stakeholder Engagement: Communicate the working with stakeholders to meet their needs/expectations, address issues as they occur, and foster appropriate stakeholder engagement in project activities throughout the project life cycle. The overriding function of management is to provide order and consistency to organizations. The primary function of leadership is to produce change and movement.

# A PM may not be able to control external factors

- A project that meet theses targets could fail to meet business case. Project objectives still have some bearing on eventual business success. E. g. a computer game could be delivered on time and within budget, but might then not sell. A project can be successfully delivered but then be a business failure. A PM may control internal factors but might not be able to control external factors.

# Failures in Project Management

- Failures in project management may be categorized according to 3 levels: a. Level 1 - Failure in the Project Management Contextb. Level 2 - Failures. Level 3 -Failures in Planning and Control Processes. Project Objectives, Functionality, Time and Cost are key factors in project failures.

# Project Management Failure

- Project Management Failure Traceable to project leadership, philosophy and practice. Include wrong project manager, neglect of systems approach in the project life cycle, and misuse of project management techniques. Examples: Hardware, software, resources and facilities are viewed independently without relation to their overall project objectives – poor resource planning.
