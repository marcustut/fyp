# The Role of AI in Artworks

- See discussions, stats, and author profiles for this publication at: https://www. Therefore, the public should be educated on the roles of AI in artworks and AI creativity though AI might not be able to fully replace human’s creativity.

# AI Artwork Style Information and Style Information

- On the other hand, humans might not be able to appreciate AI artworks emotionally as they treated it as “artificial”. Such content and style information are then combined again to produce the image in the style of the artwork [21].

# GANs cannot create creative artworks that arouse excitement

- Since art creation is tightly knitted with arousal potential of the human emotion [20, 33], GANs, failing at creating artworks that would arouse excitement, cannot produce creative artworks. According to Boden, there are three types of creativity: combinational, exploratory and transformational creativity [4].

# Generative Pre-trained Transformers

- In order to avoid radically different changes that causes a discontinuation of style, sculptor William Latham cautiously and sparingly employed GAs in his AI program, eliminating large point mutations altogether. Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) generates writings that still lack of semantic coherence and is difficult to understand [18, 11].

# Identifying Emotions in AI Artworks: A Literature Review

- com/photo/photo-of-abstract-painting-on-canvas-1626364/ 2. Based on the literature review, this study’s hypotheses are constructed as follows: H1: Undergraduates are not able to identify emotions in AI artworks.

# AI Artwork Acceptance and Exposure to AI Technology

- In the questionnaire Section 2, the portraits in questions 1 and 2 are the same images but modified with different color palettes. However, based on Table 5, there is no significant correlation between degree of exposure to AI technology and acceptance of AI artworks.

# Identifying Human versus AI Artworks

- 689 H3: Undergraduates are able to correctly identify human artwork versus AI artworks. In the next subsection, AI artworks are shown to the respondents but respondents are informed that these images are produced by human artists.
