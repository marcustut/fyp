# Software Maintenance and Evolution

- BACS3003 SOFTWARE EVOLUTION AND MAINTENANCECHAPTER 1Fundamental of Software Maintenance and EvolutionHistoryMark Halpern established the notion of software evolution in 1965 to •characterize the growth characteristics of software. Bennett and Rajlich (2000)Software Maintenance and Software Evolution All support activities carried out after delivery of software are put •under the category of maintenance.

# Reversing Software Ageing: Tools and Approaches

- , 2005)Software organisation productivity and quality in general continue to fall short of expectations, and software systems continue to show signs of ageing as they adapt to new requirements. As a result, developing tools and approaches to reverse or avoid the inherent difficulties of software ageing is critical.

# Software Evolution Tool Supporting Applications

- Supporting model evolutionIt has been found that practically all available software evolution tool assistance is largely geared at applications (i. e. , source code). As a result, the cost of verification is proportional to the system's size.

# Maintenance-Related Changes to Software Product

- Maintenance-related changes will make a system increasingly complicated unless further work is done to explicitly reduce its complexity. Changes to the software product are documented, the effects •(impacts) of the changes are discovered, artefacts are modified, testing is performed, and a new software release is prepared.
