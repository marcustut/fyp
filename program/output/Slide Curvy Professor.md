# The Young Generation Views and Acceptance of Artificial Intelligence Art

- See discussions, stats, and author profiles for this publication at: https://www. This research is a study on the young generation views and acceptance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) art based on the painting and literature created by the latest AI technologies to understand AI advancement and capabilities in the domain of art.

# Artificial Intelligence in Artistic Creativity

- Frequencies, Mean, Chi-Square, and T-Test are used in analyzing the hypotheses. Therefore, the public should be educated on the roles of AI in artworks and AI creativity though AI might not be able to fully replace human’s creativity.

---

# AI Artwork Style Information and Style Information

- On the other hand, humans might not be able to appreciate AI artworks emotionally as they treated it as “artificial”. Such content and style information are then combined again to produce the image in the style of the artwork [21].

# AI as a Collaborator

- While AI as an Imitator strives to combine an existing image with an existing art style, the goal of AI as a Collaborator is to create novel artworks itself, though with heavy human involvement. GANs consist of two algorithms in competition with one another: a generator to produce novel content after being fed with training data, and a discriminator to differentiate the original artworks from the generator’s output [23].

---

# Training GANs to Look Like Artworks

- This is because GAN generators will, under the supervision of the discriminator, ultimately tweak its outputs to an extent that they look like existing artworks. The difference lies in the training, where the discriminator instead of generator is trained to recognize the styles of artworks.

# Combinational, Exploratory and Transformational Creativity

- Its creator Cohen even elevated AARON to the height of a “world-class” colorist [40]. According to Boden, there are three types of creativity: combinational, exploratory and transformational creativity [4].

# Generative Pre-trained Transformers

- Transformational creativity includes the alteration of the dimensions that defines the conceptual space, particularly involving the breaking of rules. Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) generates writings that still lack of semantic coherence and is difficult to understand [18, 11].

# How Artist Identity Can Influence the Acceptance of AI Art

- Based on this effect, it is assumed that exposure to AI technology will affect one’s acceptance of AI artworks. Hence, we want to replicate the experiment and find out how attributed artist identity might affect the judgement on AI art.

# A Turing Test to Determine the Artwork of AI

- Section 3 is a Turing test which is used to test whether respondents could pick the correct artwork produced by AI [11]. Section (5) has five questions that involved three paintings and two writings produced by AI.

# H1: Undergraduates are unable to identify emotions in AI artworks

- Evaluation criteria were inspired by Hong and Curran’s research [26, 27] and Elkins and Chan [18]. Based on the literature review, this study’s hypotheses are constructed as follows: H1: Undergraduates are not able to identify emotions in AI artworks.

# Undergraduates are not able to identify emotions in AI artworks

- 9 FCCI 8 4 FOBE 6 3 FOAS 10 5 FOCS: Faculty of Computing and Information Technology FAFB: Faculty of Accountancy, Finance and Business FOET: Faculty of Engineering and Technology FSSH: Faculty of Social Science and Humanities FCCI: Faculty of Communication and Creative Industries FOBE: Faculty of Built Environment FOAS: Faculty of Applied Sciences Results of Each Hypotheses Test H1: Undergraduates are not able to identify emotions in AI artworks. Result of the experiment shows that 54% (mean) of the undergraduates cannot identify the intended emotion correct (Table 2).

---

# Identifying Emotions in AI Artworks

- Respondents’ identification of emotions in AI artworks. However, based on Table 5, there is no significant correlation between degree of exposure to AI technology and acceptance of AI artworks.

# 3% H4: Will you acknowledge AI as a creator of creative art?

- 9%) will you acknowledge AI as a creator of creative art (e. g. AI artist)? ” 3% H4: There is a correlation between attributed artist identity and judgement on AI artworks.

# AI Artist Identity Groups

- In this experimental test, respondents are informed that the images in a subsection are created by AI. For each attributed identity group, the human artist identity group consistently gain slightly higher ratings compared to the AI artist identity group (Table 8).
