# 7 km) l'em'ese l'e

- 7 km) long linear earthwork between Ashton-under-Lyne and Stretford in Greater Manchester, England. It may have been derived from the Anglo-Saxon Hnickar, a water spirit who seized and drowned unwary travellers, but the modern name is most likely a corruption of the name Mykelldiche and its variations; this is because the Anglo-Saxon word micel means "big" or "great", harking back to the early 13th century description of the ditch as magnum fossatum.

- [7] Legend has it Nico Ditch was completed in a single night by the inhabitants of Manchester, as a protection against Viking invaders in 869â€“870; Manchester may have been sacked by the Danes in 870. [ 14][15] In 1997, a 150-yard (140 m) segment of the ditch in Platt Fields was protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument.
